## This is the example of live conversation between Piyush Garg and his audience (Questions and Answers):- 

All right. So I think we are live.
Are we live? No idea. Let's see.
Okay. So here we have to change some settings first. So okay that's great. All right. So I think we are live. Hey guys do let me know in the chat if we are live. That's great. That's great. One minute. We have to do some settings first. Okay which YouTube doesn't give out of the box. This is cool. Get overlay URL. We have to activate this URL here. Is my voice clear? My voice is clear, right? Okay. That's great. Okay that's great. That's great. Hey hi there. Hi there. Okay all cool. Just a second. Let's do one small thing. Let's expand this a little. This looks good.

All right. So welcome to the random live stream. So I didn't have any specific plan but I thought okay, it's been a long time since I did a live, so we are here. Great great great. "Will AI" Okay, "kya baat hai, kya baat hai" (awesome, awesome) my personal favorite question. "Will AI replace developers?"
It can, absolutely. AI, let me tell you one thing, AI can replace a number of developers. I mean, it's not like it will replace the entire developer environment. But one thing is that where we need, you know, 10 developers, we can just have four to five developers, or even three to four developers, who will do the work of those 10 developers. Because yes, ultimately, tools like Claude Code, I'm not sure if you have used Claude Code, I mean, I don't I'm not sure if you have used Claude Code. But it is actually amazing. It works very well. And it solves a lot of things out of the box. I mean, you just give it context. The way it plans, the way it does things, it's very cool. So yes, in short, the answer is kind of yes and no, both. It depends on you. If you are at a senior level, then no. If you are a fresher or you haven't done much skill development, then definitely yes. All right, all right.

"New course launch when on your website?"
Dude, right now we are planning out for GenAI. I mean, what planning, we have already launched it. So right now we are completely busy in its preparation. So I have already put the link in the description. So me and Hitesh sir, we are launching **GenAI with JavaScript**. The most requested topic, the most requested cohort is this **GenAI with JavaScript**. In this, we will study Agentic AI, Agentic workflows, how AI agents are made, LangGraph, LangChain, how graph invocations happen, and I mean, prompting styles, Chain of Thought prompting, all these things we are going to study in this particular cohort. I have given the link in the description. You can check it out.

"It doesn't look good at 1x, do it at 1.5x."
Oh brother, this is a live stream. How can I talk at 1.5x in this? It will feel like I'm talking like this. I will have to speak very fast.
Okay, nice nice okay
okay

"Heard about Gemini deleting user files?"
Oh, this is common. I mean, it depends on your prompt. So, should I tell you one interesting thing about the AI world?
Should I tell you one interesting thing? One of my sirs told me this recently, I mean, it was a really great thing. Should I tell you one problem in the world of AI?
Have you ever worked with compiled languages? Compiled languages like C, okay, or C++, or Go, or Java, right? Whenever we work with compiled languages, what do we do? We always write the **source code**, right? This is what my sir told me. It was really great. Listen to this carefully. We always write the source code, right? And then what do we do? We always keep the source code saved with us. We always keep the source code saved on our GitHub. Do you ever save the compiled program? No. Because if you have the source code, you can regenerate that compiled code anytime. If I have the Java source code, I can compile it anytime and create the Java executable again. So when we are talking about the AI world right now, we are talking about **'wipe coding'**. What do we do? We write a lot of prompts, right? Like, you know, a step-by-step, we give a very big prompt that this is the project I am looking for, I need such a workflow. And surprisingly, let's say I got a very good output the first time. What do we do? We keep that output in our code, but we never save that prompt due to which I was able to generate that code. So this is a big problem in wipe coding. We are never saving the prompts. So ideally,
In wipe coding, there will be a transition where when you generate some code, from which prompt it was generated, like what was your prompt behind it to generate that particular code, that will also start getting stored. This is one thing. Do you know? Initially, when I heard this, I thought maybe it's not needed. But yes, I mean, now we have a project where we have to do something again. And then I remembered that because the output of AI is always different, saving prompts is very important. So the day is not far when prompts will start getting sold.
Okay.

"I only make projects by doing wipe code. Is this good for a company?"
See, if you are doing 100% wipe code, it is not good. The reason is that whenever you do wipe code, a personal experience is that very soon, the control of your code goes out of your hands. That stage comes very soon when you don't know what is happening and now you have to rely on wipe coding. So I would say, take a **hybrid approach**. Not even a hybrid. 70% of the code's control should be in your hands. What is happening? 30% is something that you can wipe code or you can take help from the code. Because if you are doing the entire wipe code, then if the pricing changes tomorrow or on some days the servers are down, you cannot really change anything in the code because you have no context of the code because it has completely gone out of your hands. That is one big problem which I always face.

"Hello sir, I have almost completed MERN stack, stuck in my first year. What should I do further?"
First of all, build a project. Okay. If you have done MERN stack, see technically, you have made a statement that you have done MERN stack. It means that you have knowledge about the entire system, what is Node.js, I mean what is M, what is E, what is R, and what is N. But have you ever tried to convert this into a full-fledged application? Have you made a full-stack project yourself? Have you deployed it? Have you scaled it? Have you figured out the challenges? That is where you actually learn. I mean, okay, it's a good thing. You are still in your first year, you are quite young, and it's a great achievement that you have already done MERN stack. So your step zero is complete. Now you have two steps. Number one is you have to build an application which has a lot of CRUD operations. Okay? An end-to-end project like a product. Secondly, because now the world is transitioning towards AI, try to see how you can **inject AI** into this. Because today, all startups are doing that. So okay, I mean, that will be an extra skill development. It's a very must-have skill in today's world. So MERN stack is good, but if along with MERN stack, you build a full-fledged project plus if you can somehow inject the taste of Agentic AI into it, that is going to be a really amazing project.
Okay. But yeah, congratulations, if you have finished the entire MERN stack in your first year. It's a great achievement.

Okay, this is also a nice doubt. Here comes a just a second, yeah, here comes a doubt that 'sir, is there any difference in projects between GenAI JS and GenAI with Python?' No dude, there is no difference in projects. See, our 90% cohort is the same. What we covered with Python, we will cover the same thing in JavaScript. The only major change is the language. Okay? First, we were on Python, now we will be in JavaScript. This is the main change, 90 to 95% is this change. Apart from that, we are also learning. Right? We are also learning something new every day. So whatever new things we have learned in the last one, one and a half months, we add that. And what is a good thing about our cohorts? When we have industry students, when we have industry working people, they bring very good doubts. So we never know what can come up today? So yes, that is an on-the-go learning, so that is a different thing. So if you are asking if there will be a difference? Absolutely there will be. Because cohorts are driven by students. We don't derive it. We have our own syllabus which we have to cover. But the fun part of the cohort is driven by students. They bring up the doubts, they bring up their challenges and ideas, and we really enjoy working on them.
Let me tell you one thing about the last cohort. A very fun thing. We never think about any capstone project. Okay? We never think about what we will keep as the capstone project in this. Our motive is that we have to cover GenAI Agentic and Agentic workflow. As we move forward in our cohort, we get ideas from the students. In our GenAI Cohort 2.0, we got the idea that why not create an **N8N**? You know what N8N is, right? It's a low-code AI workflow tool. So we did an iteration on this. We discussed a little with the students. It was on-the-go, we had no plan. And to be honest, our GenAI 2 students pulled it off very well. In just one or two days, they came up with a complete working product like N8N. Its UI was top-notch, the backend was top-notch. So the thing was that they just needed a guide and tools. We taught them that. So within just five to six classes, they were able to make their own N8N. That was a great thing. It was never planned. It was all on-the-go. Similarly, in our very first cohort, we made our own **Cursor**. A Cursor IDE kind of a thing, I mean, a CLI-based IDE. That was also completely on-the-go. We never planned it. We were just talking about Agentic. When Hitesh sir and I were talking to each other in a live class, an idea suddenly came that why don't we make it generate a file? And Cursor was built on-the-go. Then we added voice capability to it. We were able to do wipe coding with voice. For example, I can tell my terminal, "Hey, create a full-stack application for me," and it made it. Again, on-the-go. So dude, a lot of our things are on-the-go. So yes, there will be a difference, but the major difference is that what was in Python will now be in JavaScript.

"Best community for full-stack developers?"
Dude, I would recommend you to be active on **Twitter**. Uh, see, on Twitter, actually, what's there? Founders are there, cracked developers, who we say have broken something in the industry, all of them are very active on Twitter. So I would recommend you to come on Twitter. On LinkedIn, I mean, okay, I don't want to say anything but you know there is a lot of fake motivation on LinkedIn, right? There are just random quotes, random motivations, and a lot of irrelevant talks. But on Twitter, people talk about actual things. "Today, I did this much MRR." "Today, I did this much ARR." "I launched this." "I launched something like this on Product Hunt." "I made this today." "I did that today." "I went to the moon today." So on Twitter, I mean, there are very serious people. In the Twitter community, you actually feel a **FOMO**. And FOMO is a good thing, by the way. FOMO is a good thing, right? They say, "If you are the smartest person in the class, then you are in the wrong class." Similarly, on LinkedIn, you will feel, "Dude, I know everything." "Okay," or there is fake motivation there. Come on Twitter, you will get a reality check that dude, people are actually achieving a lot. So I would prefer Twitter any day.

## Superchat, ERP Systems, and Project Ideas

Okay. We received a super chat. Let's read this super chat now. What does this super chat say? So this super chat says, "Hello bhaiya, just wanted to know how to find good remote offers in full stack AI. Much love for you." Okay.
So dude, if you want to find remote jobs, you can do one thing, you can reach out to me a little on Twitter. Your name is Gautam, I will remember. And I just want to see a project of yours that you are really proud of because you have mentioned full stack AI. I want to see one of your full stack AI projects. This is one thing. Apart from that, if you have asked, I mean, you can obviously reach out, you can be more active on Twitter. There is one platform, I am forgetting its name a little, InstaHire, I think that's its name. That is a good platform that helps you to reach out to recruiters. So that is one thing. So you can check out that platform. Not a sponsored one, but okay, yes, it is quite good.

"Bhaiya, me and my friend want to build an ERP system. Can you please tell me the tech stack and if possible, a diagram of a simple ERP system and Agentic AI we can build this." This is a really nice one. This is a really nice one. I really like this one. You know you want to build an ERP system, Rajma Chawal. Okay, nice name. Are you from a commerce background? First, you tell me this. A question to Rajma Chawal, are you from a commerce background? Because building ERP systems is not that easy. You need knowledge about commerce. You should know what is a debit, what is a credit? You know, what are balance sheets? What is a ledger? What are cash flow statements? What are GST returns? First, you have to create a diagram with knowledge about all these things. Personally, I am from a commerce background. So yes, I mean, there is a vast syllabus in this. So first, you gather the requirements. What do you want to build? Secondly, you have to first **master the existing tools**. The best is **Tally**. Okay? You must have heard about Tally ERP. There is Tally ERP 9 and all. So study Tally a little, what is their structure, what is their database schema, how they let you create ledgers, create vouchers, what is their internal working? Try to figure out the flaws, right, where it lacks. There are a lot of flaws inside Tally. And then, I mean, the documentation work will be more in this. If you are building a tool like this, you have to first really create a very big diagram. You know I also made a project like this in my college days. Its name was **Assets Buddy**. Assets because you know, in commerce, your belongings are called assets. So AssetsBuddy.com, I made this. It was a full-fledged Zoho kind of a thing but as all developers, I left that project in the middle. Thank you so much. But yeah, I mean, I would like to follow up with you if you are building something like this. So Rajma Chawal, I am not sure what your real name is. But please do reach out to me on Twitter. And give me the context that you are working on this Tally ERP.

Yeah, I think I will have to change some settings because the messages are going away. Let's do one thing. If you are my subscriber for 5 minutes, then only you can reply to me. This is in. And one more thing we should edit here. Let's also add a slow mode. Slow mode, and not too much slow mode. Let's do it for 20 seconds. Okay? A slow mode of 20 seconds. Cool. Anything else? Okay, nice. All right. Okay. Now tell me. Slow mode is on. And we have changed some settings. Now you have to be subscribed to me for more than 5 minutes, then only you can reply here.

"What are your views regarding N8N?"
Dude, we have made N8N ourselves in our cohort. So N8N is a really great tool. You know, for those who come from a non-technical background or those who come from a non-coding background, N8N is really great. I mean, it's a little pricey. Even though it's open source. But still, its generous tier is only, I think, the free tier is only for 14 days. But N8N is a great thing. I mean, anyone can build AI agents just by dragging and dropping. So yeah, I really like the concept of N8N.

"Bhaiya, please tell me a resource to learn Terraform."
Dude, you know **Piyush Sachdeva**? His name is also Piyush. So he is a software engineer in Google. So you should check out his channel. I think it is **Tech Tutorials by Piyush**. And he is a DevOps guy. He is a master DevOps guy. So his Terraform series, I mean, 'Is Terraform', it is outstanding, outstanding, okay? No brainer. So you can definitely subscribe and follow him for Kubernetes, Terraform, or other DevOps-related things. Okay.
"Hi, say my name, Karthik." Hi Karthik.

"What's next?"
"Piyush sir, please add a lifetime access plan to your platform."
Lifetime access? Uh, my courses are already in lifetime access. I mean, there is no validity. If you purchase any course, it is lifetime. And you know why it's lifetime? Because I was very lazy to code, "Dude, who will code that after 3 years, its access should be revoked." So I said, "Okay, dude. Let it be a feature." I don't have to code, and students are getting lifetime access. I said, "Okay, it's a nice win-win situation."

"Hello sir, Suraj from Suraj from this side. Sir, what is the secret of your glow?"
Dude, I use girls' cream, that is the secret. Use Fair & Lovely. That ad was, "Why do you use girls' cream secretly?" Use that. You get a glow from that. That is my first-hand experience.

"College is a waste of time, no learning. What to do?"
Dude, this is a global problem. There is no solution to this. Because getting a degree is important, so okay, I mean, it's a matter of three-four years, bear with it a little. There is no solution to this. Try to make your evenings and your weekends productive. That's the only thing. Apart from that, okay, the whole world has to bear this, so chill. Think like, "Dude, I have to work hard my entire life, so a little chill for three-four years is fine." Think like this and do college.
"Hey hi Kaushik, Namaste Piyush sir. Coming live after a long time." Yes, dude. I am a little, a little lazy. Apart from that, I will try to be a little more consistent.

"Give some project ideas."
Dude, **OF Zindabad**. The only project you need. **OF**. The best part about this project is that if you put it on your resume, your interviewer won't ask you much, and if they ask, both will enjoy. Win-win situation. Either don't ask me about my project, or if you are asking, then okay, dude, both of us will become shameless. Totally awesome.
"What is OF?"
Okay, what is... Oh, oh, oh, oh, two-three comments came. "What is OF?" These are some of our new subscribers. No problem, you will get to know slowly. Be a little active on Twitter. See this. See this, these are some of our new subscriber friends.

"I am building a RAG application using Gemini, LangChain, vector DB. It works well for small Excel files, but results are poor with larger ones, 15,000 rows. Any suggestions on handling this file?"
Tejas, if you were a part of our cohort, you would have known the answer to this. Your **queue system** is used in this. Okay? What do you do? You can never ingest the entire file. You have to do smart chunking. So first, you have to design a queue system, a distributed queue system using Redis, a RQ, or something like that. And then what do you do? Number one is your **chunking**, then you have **chunk overlapping**, and then you basically do the **indexing part**. So this is how you do it.

## The Future of Coding and Community

"Who will answer these?"
"Who will tell, bro?"
"Lifetime access means existing and future courses."
Okay, I got your point. Let me plan it out. I will have to do a little coding, dude. Okay. Let me let me see. Okay. Okay. Okay. I got your point, Random Person.

"Should I take your cohort? I want to learn about AI."
Why not? And why do you think I will say no here? Obviously, you should take it.
Dude, you should watch our testimonials of GenAI Cohort 1 and GenAI Cohort 2. You will get your answers. "How we approach the ERP system problem?" First, tell me, why are you what, why are you rebuilding? There must be some motive, right? Where did this idea come from? Why do you want to build an ERP? It didn't just come randomly, "Okay, let's do something crazy today, let's build an ERP." First, understand this existing thing. First, read about software like Tally and Busy. Go and play with them. Play with Tally. Then you will realize, "Oh, there are so many features in this."

"Are you from Chandigarh?"
More or less from Chandigarh. Actually, I am from Patiala, but okay, Chandigarh is not too far away either. So technically, you can say that yes, I am from Chandigarh.
"I am old, I still don't know OF."
You are not active on Twitter. I mean, no problem. No problem. The chat will tell you.
Just a second, let's do this. Uh, okay, super chat. Super chat. I got a super chat of ‚Çπ20. Okay, this is also great. And anything else I missed? Okay, nice.
"I am from Chitkara Himachal Campus." Nice. I am from Chitkara Punjab Campus. Anyone from Chitkara Punjab Campus, by the way? Is anyone there from Chitkara Punjab Campus?
"CGC Landran." Okay, nice. You also live near home, I mean.
"Anyone from Thapar?"
Just a second, just a second, just a second, just a second, a very good question got missed, dude. Someone was asking...
Oh, we have people from Rajpura. Nice. Very good.
Yes, what's next? "DSA series."
Dude, I already have a course on DSA on Udemy. Very big. It's DSA with Java. I don't market it much. But yeah, I have a course on DSA with Java.

"Sir, is a CS degree mandatory to build a career?"
Dude, yes, I mean, do it, dude. Do any technical degree. Do BCA, do B.Tech, do any technical degree. As Hitesh sir said in the live stream yesterday, "You never know where it will come in handy." So yes, do it. In fact, I would say, do your masters too. See this, see this.
What to say? What to say to them? How to say?
Oh, we have one guy from Chitkara Punjab Campus. Okay, that's great. That's great. That's great.
Okay, let's move on. Let's move on. Something else good.
Dude, Golang. Golang is a very nice language. Golang is not my favorite language, but you should learn Golang. And thank you. I mean, I did Golang a long time ago. So I mean, it's really nice to learn Golang, but okay, I have mastered JavaScript. JavaScript is doing everything, so okay, it's going on with JavaScript. I also did Python. So I don't have much first-hand experience with Golang.

"Okay, can we all together develop a new operating system in India? Can we create an alternate like Microsoft?"
See, there is no lack of talent in India. That is for sure. There is absolutely no lack of talent in India. People are very talented in India. But the only problem is that there is a little less risk-taking in India. That is a thing. Because building an operating system, what is it? See, everything has a risk level. Let's say if you are working for a US company. The minimum risk. Right? If you are working for an Indian company, again, minimum risk, a little risk is there. Right? If you are working with a very early startup in India, a high risk is there, and building an operating system while staying in India is a very high risk. Okay? So that is a little risk factor, "Okay." And secondly, you know, what is the biggest problem with an operating system? I will tell you the thing. Building is never a problem. You can build anything. Indians can build anything. The whole world can build anything. Understand this. If I build an application today, let's say it's a web-based application. What will be my adoption rate? It will be very high. I made a website. I published it. I put it on my Twitter and YouTube that "Dude, this is my website, visit it." You all guys will open it. Right? Adoption, very high. On the other hand, now what did I do? I made an application, a mobile app. Okay? Only for, let's say, iOS. Now how low is my adoption rate? Right? Because Android users can't use it. And how frequently will you install an app just because someone told you to? Technically, installing an app requires some steps. Not everyone installs it. They will say, "Oh, it's an app. Okay, leave it, I will do it later." The adoption rate became low. Now you are talking about making a complete operating system. That means that if I run your operating system on my system, I will not have any apps. Because I can't use Android apps, nor can I use iOS apps. So all the developers in the world, all the companies, Adobe, Photoshop, you know, D&D, OBS, VS Code, all these software will have to be rebuilt according to your operating system. No one will do it. And if these apps which are a fundamental necessity do not run on your operating system, then why would anyone install your operating system? That's the problem, right? So technically, why do you want to create an operating system? That's the main thing. Can you compete with Linux? You can build it. But do we need to build it? There was also a B OS, an operating system. Do you remember, anyone remember B OS? Its name was BOSS. Right? B operating system, something like that was its name. I don't know what its current stage is. I think I was in fifth or sixth class when we used to read about it. Let me search for a minute. BOSS. Oh, A BOSS operating system. Yes, right? Boss operating system? Bharat Operating System Solutions. Have you ever seen this? See this, there was a Bharat Operating System Solutions. Okay.

"Oh, I missed the super chat."
Oh, you did get one super chat of ‚Çπ20, but there was no message in it. Wait, let's see again. Okay. I got ‚Çπ20 from Gopal. We will eat Kurkure. We will eat one more Kurkure.

"Product review Brain Path YT Study Mode. What is this? Where is the link to this product?"
Oh, I found it, I found it, I found it, I found it. "Is much knowledge of AI and JS needed for this new cohort?" You should only have knowledge of JavaScript. And not too advanced. I mean, if you have even made a To-Do app in JavaScript, you know a little about servers and databases, you are good to go. AI will be taught to you completely inside the cohort. Knowledge of AI is not required because the entire cohort is on AI. Your JavaScript fundamentals, your hold on JavaScript is very important.

"Who will teach in the GenAI cohort, you or Hitesh sir?"
Why not both, man? Why can't both of us teach? Why is there an 'or' condition? It is an 'and' condition. Who will teach? You AND Hitesh sir. That's the answer. Oh, we both teach. We both come. You know, just like we are on a live stream, Hitesh sir is also there, I am also there, TAs are also there. Oh, the entire cohort passes just in conversations like this. So we never keep our cohort one-sided. Our cohorts are like, Hitesh sir and I are discussing something, you know, Hitesh sir did something crazy, I did something crazy, students did something crazy, we share. Then we have, of course, we have a script which we have to teach, we teach that. And after that, we talk about some crazy things. That is how we go.

"So, do 12th marks matter in an interview?"
Who is asking you for your 12th marks? See, dude, I will tell you a simple thing. Let's assume that you have very bad marks in 12th. Okay? Very low marks in 12th. If you have achieved something good in life, then this will become an inspirational thing that you know, "I had such low marks in 12th, and still, I am here." And if you have not achieved anything, then this will become a negative thing that, "He had such low marks in 12th, it was known this would happen." So it's on you.

"How can I buy this?"
Dude, the links are in the description, bro. All the links to the GenAI cohort are given in the description down there. Check it out. One, I don't know what happens to this.

"Sir, WebDev 2."
We are planning it out, but I think it will come in January. Not sure. No promises. It can come earlier, it can also come later, but I think most probably it will be around January.

"Hey Piyush, could you tell me, tell us if you have to build something new that you don't know about it, how do you approach and implement it and guide us."
See, dude, the first step is **information collection**. Collect information. How? Get to know about that company. Get to know about that product. Use it. Use its existing alternatives. Intercept the network calls. Reverse engineer it. Brainstorm with ChatGPT, what will be their system design? Try to understand what is happening behind the scenes. Read their blogs. Read their engineering blogs. And a lot of things get reverse-engineered just from the network tab. And that is how you basically come to a point, "Oh, I have an initial infrastructure." "I have got their high-level design." That is how we go for it.

All right, all right. What else? What's next? Any good question?
"Got a good discount on my birthday. See you on 11th."
That's great. Yes, dude, it's actually Hitesh sir's birthday week. So Hitesh sir has given a little more discount. So okay, dude, you can take advantage of it. I will tell you beforehand. Because it's Hitesh sir's birthday week. That's why he is offering that discount. There won't be such a big discount. He has never given such a big discount. It's just because of Hitesh sir's birthday week. So dude, I mean, okay, if you want to take advantage, you can.

"What's next in GenAI? I am also from a B.Com background. I am now a two-year experienced in MERN stack, also done GenAI Cohort First Batch. Oh, now what's next?"
Now, Nidhi, you should build something really exciting, really one project that you are really proud of. I will tell you one thing. This is a nice one. Like, it's usually a very common question. "What's next?" You know, all good, well-crafted developers have one thing in common: they have a big side project under their belt to which they are really proud of. So if you want to come into the category of a good developer, you should also have a project like this, a product like this, on which, number one, you are spending your entire weekend. I am not saying that you have to spend your entire weekday. No, on weekdays, wherever you are working, continue to work there. But your weekends, your Saturday and Sunday, should go into that project. And this project will always keep growing. Because you are obviously giving two days a week. And this is something you should be really proud of. It is possible that someday this might become a monetizable product for you. So, this is one thing that you should always have. Every every developer has it. Every developer, every good developer to be precise. If any developer comes to me and says that I have five years of experience, I am a senior developer, then I say that what you did for the company is good. But what did you do personally? What did you do on Saturday and Sunday? Tell me about a personal project of yours. A good developer takes care of their side project like their own children and works on it.

"On which course is the discount?"
Dude, we are talking about GenAI. The link will be in the description, right? I have put the link in the description, right? Guys, can you confirm? The link I have put in the description, have I put it? Am I not just talking like this? Let me check for a second. Let me check, copy. We will mute this and paste. Yes, dude, I have put it. The GenAI with JavaScript cohort link. I have put it. It's opening. It's opening completely. It's opening completely. I will show you one thing there. Actually, the pricing that is showing there is not the pricing.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Happy Birthday celebration is going on. Hi Hitesh sir. Dude, I have joined the live stream from OBS. Otherwise, I would have definitely joined Hitesh sir. The problem with OBS is that you cannot invite guests. Really sorry, Hitesh sir. But yeah, Happy Birthday celebrations are going on. Hitesh sir has given a very generous discount. Take advantage of it. The pricing is shown differently outside, but when you really go to the you know, the pay section, the entire pricing drops. Go and see once. "Oh, I missed yours." Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Let's go to fan funding.

"10 years of experience in MERN stack, I have forgotten everything. I don't remember tech terms, now interviews are not getting cleared. Should I join the GenAI course?"
Dude, if you have experience in JavaScript, plus plus plus you are genuinely interested because dude, interest matters. I don't want you to come with the expectation that you know, I will just get some syllabus and I will mug it up. No, you have to be genuinely interested because dude, coding is a very interesting thing, right? You should have that passion for building stuff. So if you have that passion, you really get a dopamine hit from building something, from learning something new. And you know JavaScript, then sir, you are most welcome.
Just a second.
Yeah.
Okay, what's next?
Okay, let's have a live for 5 more minutes and then we will leave.

"Duration of GenAI new cohort?"
Our duration is the same, approximately one month, and whatever time it takes, it takes. Okay? We have added the detailed curriculum on the website, approximately one month.

"Kubernetes course?"
Kubernetes course? There are no plans for a Kubernetes course right now, brother.

"Okay, okay, okay. Uh, bhaiya, I have one year of experience in software development. Served notice period. Now building an LMS for showcasing my skills. Oh, are you building a competing LMS?"
And I want to sell... I am kidding. And I want to sell...


## This is the another example of live conversation between Piyush Garg and his audience (Questions and Answers):- 

Okay, so I guess we are live, guys. Are we live? Okay, so I think we are live, guys. Let me know if you can hear me out, if you can see me. Kya hum live hain? Can you see me live, guys? Are you able to see me live? I think thodi si latency hogi but that's fine. But mere ko yeh batao ki kya hum live hain? Kya aapko meri audio sahi se aa rahi hai? Bahut badhiya. So bahut hi janmon ke baad hum aaye hain wapas live. Okay so congratulations. Thank you so much Kaushik. Oh, we have Vinayak here. Hi Vinayak Sir. Hello ji. Intent hamare paas kuch founder yahan par aaye hue hain. To Vinayak, aapka interns kaise chal rahe hain? Mile aapko interns?

Hello, hello, hello. Thank you so much Vinayak. Hello beta, kaise ho? Badhiya ji, badhiya. Hello beta, seedha beta, nice. Happy New Year in advance. Thank you so much Aditya. Thank you so much for being a member. Dekho guys, Aditya is a member. Thank you so much Aditya and congratulations for 200k. Thank you so much, thank you, thank you, thank you, really so much. Hi, hello, hello, hello. Mere paas chat thodi si ho rahi hai lag. Okay, ya, now it's working. Okay so questions lete hain. Aur Vinayak, kya, kaise chal raha hai Intent JS? Kya bana rahe ho Intent JS pe? Can we build India GPT? Are bilkul bana sakte hain yaar India GPT. Kyun nahi bana sakte? Yaar, Indians kis cheez mein kam thodi hain? The problem is ki hum thoda job hunting ki taraf zyada dhyan dete hain but agar India GPT jaisi cheezon banane pe aa gaya to poori duniya ki vat laga dega, that I am sure.

Sir aap alive ho? Alive bhi hain aur live bhi hain. New Year ka kya plan? New Year ka matlab as such to kuch plan nahi, bas coding karenge as always. Pichle 2 saalon se, 10 saalon se bhi wahi kar rahe hain, aage bhi wahi karenge. To bas coding. 50% off coupon code de do cohort one ka. 50% off to dekho yaar, karna thoda sa hoga difficult. Mere agar yeh possible hota main pakka kar deta but 50% thoda sa zyada hai. But koi baat nahi, agar aapne manga hai to aapko nirash nahi karenge, aapko pakka ek bahut acchi deal denge is particular live ke andar. So is live ke andar bane rahiye, aapko ek bahut acchi deal milegi. News channel wali aadat pad gayi hai.

Okay, mere ko Manu Paaji ka message aa raha tha ki woh chat mein join karenge, pata nahi kab aayenge? To theek hai, Anupa ji ka bhi wait karte hain. Working on React integration with Intent. Yes, that's gonna be super cool. Yeh main dekhna chahta hoon ki kaise karoge aap. Congratulations. Thank you so much, thank you so much. Projects in cohort? Yaar dekho, humne na project ke upar kaafi dhyan diya hai. Actually mein abhi bhi hum jo project bana rahe hain na jo hum matlab usmein mein daalenge cohort mein woh hum abhi bhi plan out hi kar rahe hain. Humne already 25-26 projects plan out kar liye hain. More are going on. Har phase ke andar projects hain. Okay, for example, HTML, CSS. Let's say humne ek project banaya. Theek hai? Matlab kuch bhi ek structure banaya. Uske andar na hum bahut saari cheezein chhod denge deliberately. For example, hum uske andar bugs chhod denge. Hum aapko documentation denge, hum aapko requirements denge jaise client requirements hoti hain. What you have to do is, you have to complete that. Aapko usko debug karna hai, usko complete bhi karna hai, missing parts ko jodna bhi hai. Bahut chhote-chhote bugs honge, woh bhi aapko resolve karne hain. Bade features bhi implement karne hain jaise aap ek real world open source contribution karte ho ya jaise aap companies mein kaam karte ho. Kuch is tarah ke projects hamare paas hone wale hain. So that is the whole plan. Okay? Along with, along with a lot of assignments and aptitude questions. To woh jitna bhi schedule hai aap check kar sakte ho. You can visit like piyush.dev/cohort.

So I got intern for backend development in a paid startup. Really thanks for your backend. That's so cool. Agar tum Javascript ke saath nahi kheloge, phir Javascript tumhare saath khele gi, simple funda. Kis koi ek na ek khelega to better ki tum uske saath khelo. Theek hai? Theek hai? Aur questions lete hain. Badhiya, badhiya. Kahan the aap? Hum? Are yaar. Docker ka course milega kya 200k ke liye? Are, Docker ka course? Haan, humne pichli baar hai na Docker ka course giveaway kiya tha. Theek hai? Ek kaam karte hain. Aaj do cheezein karte hain. Theek hai? Aaj is live ke andar do cheezein karenge. Number one, Docker course giveaway kar denge aur discount coupon for cohort. Theek hai? Manu Paaji ka mere ko chat nahi dikh rahi. Manu Paaji aap kuch likh rahe ho kya? Mere ko Manu Paaji ki koi bhi chat nahi dikh rahi hai. Manu Paaji kidhar hain? Oh, Manu Paaji ne accha Super Chat bheja hai. ‚Çπ400 ki Super Chat aayi hamare paas Eternity ke malik se. Which is 6969. Isko to hum pin kar denge. Ruko, isko mujhe pin karna hai. Pin kaise karte hain? Haan. Isko hum karenge, are, pin kaise hoga? Haan, very good. To dekho yaar, Eternity ke malik ji, jinka badhiya MRR hai, woh humein ‚Çπ400 de rahe hain. Nice. Thank you so much Manu Paaji. Lekin aapne jo likha hai woh mujhe samajh nahi aaya hai. Yeh code language mere ko samajh nahi aayi hai. Thoda sa iske upar agar aap prakash fekenge to badhiya hoga. Saath-saath mein Twitter open kar leta hoon.

Okay. Theek hai? Thode se aur question lete hain, phir kuch masti karenge. Theek hai? Manu Sir OP. Yahan par Manu ke zyada fans hain. Koi bhi tweet daalo, do jano ke fans hote hain, ya Manu ke, ya Vinayak ke. Badhiya hai, badhiya hai. Sir, coupon code de do. Are, haan-haan, pakka denge. Theek hai? Jo-jo live stream mein bana rahega, badhiya coupon code denge. Theek hai? Live stream mein bane rahiye and coupon code paaiye. Are, chat ek second mere ko na woh dekhne do ki yahan pe Super Chat kis-kis ne diya? Vinayak. Are bhai sahab Vinayak, ‚Çπ800. Nice. Aaj to bhaiya party ho gayi, ‚Çπ800 to hamare ban gaye. Oh, ek aur ‚Çπ400. Hoodie acchi hai bhaiya. Thank you so much. Aisi ‚Çπ400 ‚Çπ400 milte rahe, main ek aur hoodie leke aunga. Are Vinayak, by the way hamare channel ke member bhi hain. Manu Paaji sahi kehte hain, Vinayak ke paas paisa bahut hai. Bhaiya K8s series ki playlist banao. Are woh already in plan hai. I am already making K8s ki series and main tumhe ek cheez dikhaoon? Maine ek book ko refer kar raha hoon. Woh book bahut acchi hai to uske upar poori K8s series hone wali hai. Let me see, maine woh book kahan rakh di? Theek hai? Ek second, main aapko dikhaoon woh book.

Okay, so yaar yeh ek book hai which is which I'm matlab maine almost matlab maine poori hi complete kar di hai. To main aapko dikhata hoon. Theek hai? Yeh ek book hai. Yeh na poori jo book hai, this is on Kubernetes. You can see. Theek hai? To yeh book maine almost matlab ek baar to poori khatam kar di hai, dobara bhi ek baar padh liya. To yaar ek baar na ismein kuch last ke chapters hain jo security ke. To ek baar mere woh khatam ho jaaye, phir uske baad pakka Kubernetes ke upar series. Are bhai sahab Manu Paaji, yeh kya ‚Çπ6900. ‚Çπ69. Manu Paaji, yeh to yaar main aapko stream ke baad wapas karunga. Bhai, itna mat kijiye. Manu Paaji. Yaar ek to main OBS se live hua main aapko invite bhi nahi kar sakta. Ek second, let me. Kya karunga main ‚Çπ6900 ka? Kya hi aata hai ‚Çπ6900 mein bhai? Dekh rahe ho Manu Paaji aur yeh kehte hain Vinayak ke paas paisa bahut hai. Open source bana raha hoon, paise nahi hain. Vinayak ke paas paisa bahut hai. Give me a suggestion for online code editor with MERN. Paisa hi paisa. Bhai dekho, ‚Çπ6900 to hamare ban bhi gaye.

Manu Paaji ne na mere ko ek message bheja hai. Main hai na yahan pe woh dikha nahi sakta because this is an educational channel aur uski maryada banaye rakhte hain. Manu Paaji naughty ho rahe hain. Time ho gaya na 10:30 baj gaye. You know what I mean? Ab ‚Çπ6000 mein nahi milti, mehangi ho gayi. Yeh dekho yeh yeh aaye hain bacche padhne ke liye. Do tarah ke bacche hote hain dekho, ek jo cohort ka coupon code maang rahe, doosra jo mehangai ke baare mein baat kar rahe hain. Hello Piyush sir, aap har technology ke liye book padhte hain kya? Yaar ek cheez batata hoon main tumhe. Very good question. Matlab I think yeh question kaafi aur bhi aa raha tha, repeat ho raha tha ki book kyun? Do cheezein hoti hain. Jaise for example, agar mere ko kuch bhi naya padhna hai, bilkul absolute new. Right? Us case mein pehle I watch a video. Book. Woh cheez na forever tumhare mind ke andar na print ho jaati hai. This is what I have noticed. Bhai Vinayak, ‚Çπ2000. Bhai tum dono ki ladai mein na main Ambani ko cross kar jaunga. Tum dono competition kar rahe ho kya, Manu Paaji aur Vinayak? Bhai dekho, sabhi janne jaake pehle to A10 ka license khareed do Pro ka. Theek hai? Number one. Theek hai? Yeh sponsored video nahi hai mere ko kisi bhi tarah ke ‚Çπ6969 nahi mile hain. Aur doosra Intent JS ko jaake fork karo, star karo. Is cheez ke bhi mere ko koi paise nahi mile hain. Main apne man se keh raha hoon. Theek hai?

Yeh dekho. Bhagwan ka diya hai. Bhagwan ka diya hua hai sab kuch sahi hai. Aisa lag raha hai jaise main koi betting karwa raha hoon jaise woh nahi hoti auction chal rahi hoti hai. Vinayak ‚Çπ2000 uske baad Manu Paaji ‚Çπ6000. Uske baad next dekhte hain. Vinayak, by the way, hoodies bheje ga aap sabko. Jo aaj ke chat mein bade active rahega, Vinayak usko hoodie bheje ga. 18% GST. Taai ji baithi hain. Congrats sir for 200k. Are Hemant sir, thank you so much, thank you, thank you so much. Kaise hain Hemant sir aap? Yeh Vinayak ke paas paisa bahut hai isko bhi hum pin kar dete hain. Ek to pin ka button nahi aa raha pata nahi kyun. Sir cohort ka refund chahiye. Koi baat nahi aap mere ko apni mail ID de do aur you will get it. That's fine. Manu Arora dikha do Paaji. Are Manu bhai, maine aapki waise Instagram pe ek story daali thi. To main wahi dekh raha tha. Woh jo ‚Çπ6969 wali badhiya lag rahi hai, woh bhi kab bhijwa rahe ho?

Theek hai? Let's see hum next kya pick up kar sakte hain. Yaar main kisi tarah se Vinayak ko, kis tarah se Manu Paaji ko invite karna chahta hoon live stream pe. Main kaise karoon? OBS ke andar option hota hai kya? Can I invite someone directly? OBS ke andar mere ko agar thoda pehle pata hota main ya to Zoom pe ya Google Meet pe karta. How, sir? How did you learn new technologies? Koi aisa ek tareeka nahi hai, multiple tareeke hain. YouTube. First of all, why do you want to learn this? Learn this technology? Koi problem solve kar rahi hai? Are you facing some problem? If yes, what problem is that? Second, a pehle us product ko samjho, us technology ko samjho that what that technology is offering you. Then watch some YouTube video. Ek-dedh ghante ki playlist lagao sirf jaise hota hai na ek introductory video. Just to see ki haan yeh karti kya hai? Iska pichhe ka intention kya hai? Woh sab cheezein. Uske baad, when you are really into it ki haan yaar this is something I want to learn, mera ismein interest hai to then I deep dive into some big playlist. Uske baad documentation and then I start building something. That is how basically I learn. Theek hai? To ya, that is basically it. Next time na hum Vinayak ko aur abhi na next, abhi main soch raha hoon ki thoda live stream na frequent karein. To next hum Vinayak aur Manu Paaji dono ko invite karenge, phir dekho kya entertainment hota hai. Manu, Vinayak, please be ready on either Monday or Tuesday. Theek hai? Chalega aapko?

Theek hai? I think ek request kaafi zyada aa rahi hai ki coupon code for cohort. Ek second, main aapko coupon code doon cohort ka. Chahiye coupon code? Chalo main aapko coupon code deta hoon cohort ka. Ek kaam karte hain. Abhi jab tak yeh live stream active hai, tab tak coupon code banata hai. Matlab ki raat tak ka bana deta hoon. Theek hai? To aaj raat tak active rahega. So you can actually visit piyush.dev/cohort aur coupon code ka name main bana deta hoon. Kya banaun? PiyushLive karke bana dete hain. Ruko, yeh lo guys. Maine ek bana diya coupon code. Isko use kar sakte ho. Theek hai? Maine link bhi de diya hai and jo coupon code hai, uska naam hai PiyushLive. Theek hai? To PiyushLive aap coupon code ek baar try karo. Coupon code chal raha hai kya? Theek hai? Yeh aap try kar sakte ho. To yeh aaj raat tak active rahega. It's kind of a flash sale. Bhai Vinayak phir se. Bhai please mat karo, honestly. Please Vinayak and Manu Paaji, mere ko itna guilt mat do. Dekh rahe ho, dost ho to aise. Vinayak ke paas paisa bahut hai. Pushpa 2 dekha kya? Kaisa laga aapko? Maine abhi tak woh dekhi nahi hai movie. Bhai, maine honestly abhi tak movie dekhi nahi hai.

How to showcase a backend project? Deployment. Deployment is also part of a backend development. Deploy the project and uske upar tum tweets likho, thodi si videos banao ki maine yeh banaya. Baaki dekho, main tumhe ek cheez batata hoon. Yahan pe no promotion honestly, matlab yeh main bata raha hoon. A10 pro to what I do is, jab bhi mere ko koi backend project banana hota hai, I have A10 pro. Mujhe bas wahan se components uthane hote hain, mere ko lagane hote hain and out of the box mere paas bahut hi acche animated animation, animated components hote hain. To as a backend developer na, you should have some kind of subscription like that. Matlab pehle main Tailwind ka use karta tha. I have Tailwind Pro as well but phir uske baad maine is matlab Manu Paaji gifted me the pro.a10. To uske baad kya hai ki like this is very good. Matlab main kya kar sakta hoon? Go to pro.a10. Koi bhi components hai, bane banaye components. Right? Raw nahi hai, pre-built components uthao, daalo, apna data daalo and good to go.

Okay, guys, ek aur ‚Çπ1000 aaye. Mere ko Manu Paaji aur Vinayak ko block hi karna padega. Manu Paaji, ab. Aa, we got one more here. I made a SaaS social media automation for pata hai ek second ruko. Haan, ab poora aa raha hai na? Nice. To basically yaar yeh jo tumne project banaya, honestly kaafi accha hai. Matlab tumne generative AI ko use kiya aur tumne automation banaya. Initial clients lekar aane ke liye, I would say ki tum what you can do is Twitter ke upar you can get potential clients. Theek hai? To be active on Twitter. Tum mere ko Twitter pe tag karna, main tumhe like, you know, retweet aur like karunga.

I am in 4th year or pass out. Mujhe tension bahut rehti hai due to too much stress. Dekho, rule number one, don't stress out. Theek hai? Yeh jo hamari technology ki line hai na, yeh aise hi hai. Sometimes there are a lot of jobs, sometimes there is no job, sometimes there are a lot of paid job. To yeh chalta rehta hai. The only thing is, see it as an opportunity. See, jab is field mein job zyada hai, grab a job. Let's say. Theek hai? Abhi nahi bhi hai, that's fine. It's an opportunity for you. This is the time to upskill because jab hum apne you know, jobs mein busy hote hain na, day to day humein time nahi milta kuch bhi new build karne ka, kuch bhi new seekhne ka, apne aap ko upskill karne ka time nahi milta. You get actually exhausted day working whole day in your job. To jab tumhare paas job nahi hai na, start learning new things. Then finally kya hota hai? Jab wapas se yeh pick up karti hai, right? Companies start hiring. Then showing that skills, showing that projects, you can grab that job. Phir wapas se ho sakta hai you can get laid off. Okay? Because hota hai. Theek hai? Is field mein hota hai. I have seen that. Then it is again time to build something, to learn something new. So go with the flow, that's fine. Don't be stressed out. Rule number one, stress out nahi karna. Okay? Go with the flow. Vinayak ka ek aur ‚Çπ1000 aaya. Pakka last, ab nahi kar raha Super Chat.

Guys, agar tumhein paison ki tension hai na, Manu Paaji aur Vinayak ko dost bana lo. Please. Vinayak sir aur mat dijiye aap. Aapne badi pehle mere ko Diwali pe dekho gifts dekho. Vinayak and Manu Paaji, kya super bande hain. Dekho, dono ne mere ko pehle to Manu Paaji ne mere ko free A10 ka pro license diya. Uske baad inhone mere ko Diwali par gifts bheje. Vinayak ne bhi, Manu Paaji ne bhi. Ab Vinayak ne mere ko hoodies bheji, Manu Paaji bhi mere ko hoodies bhej rahe hain. Phir live chat ke andar mere ko you know, they are giving Super Chat. Dekh rahe ho, aise dost banao. By the way, on a side note, Manu Paaji and Vinayak, both are cracked engineers. The way they are building na, matlab I can't really think matlab ki woh itni chhoti age mein they are really building a lot of great stuff. And inka combination kitna sahi hai? One on pure backend and one on pure frontend. I mean, agar yeh dono milke koi company, koi project pe kaam kare, it's gonna be next level. Kyunki Vinayak ka backend aisa hai ki poori duniya baat karegi. And I think dono bachpan se dost hain. So dekh rahe ho, kehte hain na, jodiyaan upar wala banata hai? Yeh perfect jodi hai.

Hitesh Chaudhary ka, you dumb me and aapka cohort. Haan yaar, cohort is gonna abhi poora jo 2025 ka focus hai na, woh cohort ko successful banane mein hai. To uske andar humne poori apni energy laga deni hai. Projects, content pe, har cheez pe. Aur aapne alumni network wagera bhi dekha hi hoga jo Hitesh sir ne share kiya tha. To 2025 ki jo poori energy lagne wali hai, woh hai cohort ke content pe. Theek hai? Let's see, let's see. A dekho Abhinav, I have purchased your cohort and I hope it will help me in React Native and mobile development. Dekho, yahan pe do cheezein hain. Number one, React agar aapko aati hai, right? Which is promised in the course, that is React. Agar aapko React aati hai na to React Native kaafi zyada knowledge transferable hai. Bahut saari aapki React ki hi knowledge transfer ho jayegi React Native mein. Kuch cheezein hongi jo aapko shayad seekhni pad sakti hain to transition into React Native. Second, hum React Native waise to promised nahi kar rahe hain. Theek hai? Because woh ek web dev ka a cohort hai, usmein React Native kahin par bhi promised nahi hai. But Hitesh sir, okay? Or me, might take some extra classes on web on mobile development also. But again, there is no promise on that. Okay? Promise is on web development and React. But agar aapko React acche se aa jayegi na to React Native mein transition karna is just like ek weekend ka kaam.

Okay. A Nest JS with Fastify? Nest JS with Fastify. Okay. Like industry standards coding structure bana sakte hain. I mean, I have heard a lot of good things about Nest JS and Nest JS ke bajaye Intent try karo. Intent JS which is built by which is which Vinayak is building. So try Intent JS. It has a lot of batteries included. It's kind of a Laravel. Jaise Laravel works for PHP, Intent JS is for Node.js. To ek baar Intent JS try karna. A so waise to woh kaafi stable hai, ab Intent JS to ek baar I think Vinayak ek ek video banayenge. Theek hai? Ek dedicated video on Intent JS. So you will come to know kitna powerful Intent hai. So wait karo. Theek hai? Ek baar uske liye. Manu Paaji, be my secret Santa. Manu Paaji. Oh, one more Super Chat. Can you please create a paid backend course like Redis, how to deploy, how to handle web sockets, latency, CI/CD etc and everything. Suraj, I will tell you one thing. Yeh sab cheezein hai na, kaafi kaafi sab cheezein already mere cohort ke andar hain. We have a backend ka poora module jiske andar you have Redis, you have deployment. Deployment ke andar you have container-based deployment and then you have kya tha? Container-based deployment, ECR, ECS, EC2-based deployment, simple VPS-based deployment. To woh sab cheezein hai. Then web sockets and all, everything is there. CI/CD pipeline, everything is there in the cohort. So maybe you if you want to go in the paid site, you can go in the cohort. Baaki yaar yeh sab cheezein free mein bhi hai mere channel ke upar.

Aur Manu sir ka big fan hoon. Like you guys have reposted my tweets as well when I built something. Really cool. Means a lot. That's so cool man. That's so cool. Aur ek cheez mujhe dekhkar na yeh jo hamari young generation hai, they are really more talented because jab hum college mein the, humein zyada kuch nahi aata tha. Theek hai? But seeing you people building a lot of good stuff, gives us a lot of motivation and feels ki yes, we are also connected to the right audience. Theek hai? So keep building, keep sharing. Make Three.js course. Yaar yeh na I would expect from Manu Paaji. Manu Paaji, aap ek banao na yaar Three.js ka course. Hamare paas frontend ke yahan par diggaj hain. To Manu Paaji, aap banao ek Three.js ka course. Okay. This is very good question. Sir, how to plan and build your own project from scratch? Very good question. Number one, take pen and paper. Planning is very important. Main tumhe ek cheez dikhata hoon. Theek hai? Aaj bhi jab bhi mere ko kuch banana hota hai, I use two things. Either I use Eraser. Mera poora jo eraser.io hai, bhara hua hai. Theek hai? Project ke saath. Doosra agar main kabhi matlab I am away from my you know, laptop to I use copy and pen. You can see, copy pen, yeh poora bhara hua hai. To I first design all the architecture on copy pen or eraser.io. To initially copy pen because woh thoda scribbling hota hai, thoda rough hota hai. Then I you know, make a mind map, everything on the eraser.io. I can share it with my teammates. Once you have the plan ready na, uske baad code karna is the easiest thing. If you have all the components, all the structure, data flow. So this is basically how I plan. Number one, scribbling on copy pen. Then going to the eraser.io to make it in a structured way. Taking help of AI also ki agar main kahin pe kuch galti to nahi kar raha and then finally to the coding part.

Okay. How to beat procrastination? How to beat procrastination? Yaar iska matlab this is a very tough question honestly, because I also procrastinate a lot tabhi 9 mahine baad live stream aa rahi hai. Baaki the best is ki you know, you always say to your mind ki mere ko agar koi kaam nahi karna hai. Just say ki accha kar leta hoon. Sirf 5 minute karunga. Because sabse badi problem kya hoti hai? Mere saath, mere ko yahan tak aane mein sabse badi dikkat aati hai kai baari. Like you know, bahar mausam accha hai, hai na? Aur mera kaam karne ka man nahi kar raha hai. To the problem is ki mere ko bas is desk tak aane mein problem hai. Agar main kisi tarah se is desk tak pahunch jaaun, apne workspace tak pahunch jaaun, then I know that I will complete my work and then get up. So I just have to convince myself ki mujhe yahan tak aana hai aur uske na maine bahut funny-funny tareeke dhoondh rakhe hain. For example, main kya karta hoon? Maine apne phone ke saare chargers isi desk pe rakh rakhe hain. To kya hota hai? Agar mere phone ki battery low hai, because I am let's say scrolling reels, to mere ko charging pe lagane ke liye yahan tak aana padega. Aur jaise hi main yahan pe aaunga, I can do something work. Ya phir main kabhi-kabhi apna mobile yahan pe chhod jaata hoon so that ki jab bhi apna mobile yahan pe lene aunga, I can work. So I mean it's a hack around which you can also figure out which works best for you but that's actually how I do. Okay. What else? What else? Ya mere ko lagta hai live stream ke andar na bahut zyada latency chal rahi hai. Guys, if you can hear me, just say yes. If you can hear me, just say yes.

Successfully built a scalable, ek second, poora nahi dikh raha hai. Successfully built a scalable notification system design, shared system design four months ago in five days. Maza aa gaya. Nice man, Aditya. I see a lot of posts from you. I see that you are really active on my reels and on my LinkedIn, on my Twitter. And ki tumne kya build kiya. To milte hain aapko cohort ke andar and kabhi na kabhi waise bhi hum kabhi baat karenge. So good job man, good job. You are really putting efforts. Okay. What's next? Hi Piyush, how valuable do you think AWS certifications are in terms of boosting career, projects and demonstrating skills? Main tumhe ek baat batata hoon. Dekho, agar tumhe waise koi value add nahi karte, jo AWS certifications hai na, cloud practitioner ya koi bhi cloud architect and all, woh koi bhi aapko value provide nahi karte. But if you are working for foreign clients, European clients or UK based clients, US based clients to wahan pe sometimes they ask you ki agar aapko hamare saath kaam karna hai the certification is required, is mandatory. To us case mein to aapke paas koi option nahi hai, you have to take it. But agar abhi tak kisi ne nahi manga and it like it's working, to aapko woh certifications karne ki koi zaroorat nahi hai. Ultimately knowledge matters. Theek hai? Lekin when you go for a client work, B2B work ya phir aap kisi ko service de rahe hain as a cloud, to wahan pe aapko woh certifications karni padti hai because the other company asks it.

Bro, internship season session are going on in my college. Last 15 days left, still no offer. Any advice? Have skills but still. Tum tumne aaj tak, theek hai? Ek baat batao, I don't know you like Sanskar Singh. A tell me just one project, one project which you are really proud of that you have built. Tell me just a single project jo tumne banaya aur jiske upar tum bahut zyada proud ho. Theek hai? I will wait for your message in the chat. I have joined your cohort. Okay. BCA students. A BCA student currently working on TCS support project. A is it effect? Okay. To you are working on a TCS support. How to find jobs on native iOS development as fresher after working support project? Any guidance please? A you want to find a job on native iOS development? Do you know iOS by the way? I mean, d-do you have knowledge with like Swift and everything? First of all. Doosra na, a iske andar clients milna thoda easy hota hai. You can go to websites like Upwork, right? And you can find your clients there. To iOS ke andar. But tell me just one thing, why do you want to go native into the iOS development? I mean, itna targeted market matlab itna targeted a area ke andar tum kyun target kar rahe ho that you want to go directly into the native iOS development? Any specific reason for that? Guys, main coupon code phir se share kar deta hoon. No reason that yeh hai coupon code. To pin kyun nahi kar pa raha?

Okay. Anyway. Theek hai? Aditya, tum DM kar sakte ho. Baaki koi baat nahi, hum cohort mein to mil hi rahe hain. Sir namaste. Namaste ji. Bhai, model fine-tuning ke upar koi video banao. Kaafi easy hai yaar. Matlab iske upar dedicated video, theek hai? Plan kar sakte hain. Matlab abhi kuch aise promise to nahi kar sakta. Abhi filhal ek hi cheez hai mere radar pe, woh hai Kubernetes. Mere ko iske upar series banani hai to this is what I am preparing for. Honestly. Pin khatam ho gaye honge. Are saare pin Vinayak aur Manu Paaji ne le liye. Main khud ki messages ko pin nahi kar pa raha hoon. Mere pin khatam ho gaye. Any new course on? Haan, wahi. Matlab I am planning Kubernetes. Koi promise nahi hai but haan that is what I am planning next. Kitne viewers hain abhi concurrently? 381. Nice. Agar concurrent abhi jo viewers hain agar woh 500 touch kar jaate hain to Docker course giveaway. Theek hai? Theek hai? Agar 500 touch karte hain to giveaway kar denge. Batao. Theek hai? Jab 500 ho jayenge, mere ko bata dena. Yes sir, because of money. Which role would be best? A dekho, backend aur frontend, yeh dono roles mein accha paisa hai. Theek hai? Abhi filhal matlab don't go with a matlab backend ka matlab yeh hona chahiye ki tumhein backend aata hai. Theek hai? Aisa nahi hai ki bas backend ke naam pe Node.js aur Express seekh liye, backend ho gaya. Nahi. Either go with pure backend. Theek hai? Choose a niche. Theek hai? Pehle dono ko padho. Be a full-stack developer first. Tumhein dono cheezein aati hain. But uske baad have a specialization. For example, jaise Manu Paaji hain. Theek hai? Unko dono aata hai. He knows how to code backend, he knows how to code frontend. But he is core into the frontend. Frontend ka matlab unko aata hai frontend ki animation kaise banani hai? Animation libraries like Framer Motion ke saath kaam kaise karna hai? Components kaise build up karne hain? How to think that way? To either go in that way ya phir agar aap backend path choose kar rahe ho to be be a backend developer. Tumhein har cheez aati hai backend pe. Whether it's optimization, deployment, queue system, system design, scalable systems, databases ke baare mein tumhein SQL bhi aata hai, tumhein NoSQL bhi aata hai. So either go in that direction. So have, first of all, be a full-stack developer jisko dono aata hai but specialization in one. So these are the two field jiske andar there is a good money plus aajkal thoda sa AI ke andar bhi there is a good money if you can build AI agents. To woh ek quick cash machine hai a aaj ke time mein because ismein zyada log nahi hain and big companies want AI agents. So if you can build something like that, that is also a good thing.

Ya, main Sanskar ke message ka wait kar raha tha. Sanskar ko maine bola tha, what is that one project? Mere ko batana. Agar Sanskar ka message aaya mere ko chat mein to kahin dikh nahi raha hai. A not Sanskar, iska naam kya tha? I think he was Sanskar Singh jisko maine bola tha ki like what is that one project which you are really proud of? I am not sure uska name kya tha but I am waiting for his message. Brother, can you explain about serverless computing? Are, I have full dedicated video on it. Channel ke upar search karna what is serverless? Poori dedicated videos mein tumhe pata lagega ki serverless aur server full architecture mein exactly kya fark hai. Theek hai? Aur tumhe pata lagega reality mein serverless kuch nahi hota. Serverless means you don't manage the servers. You don't take the headache of managing and configuring the server. Yaar mere paas chat repeat kyun ho rahi hai?

Haan. Agar 500 concurrent viewers aate hain to hum Docker Pro course giveaway kar denge. Thode se. Theek hai? Baaki maine uska to by the way, ek baat batao, coupon code use ho raha hai kya? Coupon code chal raha hai na jo maine abhi share kiya, PiyushLive?

Build your own vector database. Okay. Yeh mere ko thoda padhna padega. Build your own vector database. Matlab vector database kaam kaise karna hai woh to hum aapko bata sakte hain but building own vector database, padh lenge ek baar. Theek hai? Good project idea, note kar lete hain. Theek hai? Should I go for Macbook? Definitely. It's a very powerful machine and very highly recommended machine for all the programmers. So even a Macbook Air with an M3 chip is very good. So ya, you should definitely go for Macbook if it is in your budget. A niche request if possible, can you create playlist for integrating Rust with Python? Are, aisa same project hamara Discord server mein bhi chal raha tha. They were integrating Rust with a Node.js. To jitni bhi core libraries hai na, standard libraries like file reading libraries and everything, to woh sabko Rust mein write karke they were trying to use it in the Node.js. So Shub, ek hai in our Discord server. More guy, I am forgetting his name. To try kar sakte hain. Yeh cheez try kar sakte hain. Waise bhi main pichle do mahine se Python ke andar hi work kar raha hoon. Mera pichla poora do mahina core Python ke andar nikla hai. Matlab I was working with the company to I am just working on pure Python on AI side, AI agent and AI stuff. So amazing field yaar. Matlab jo AI agent matlab amazing field hai, a whole new experience it was. About data science for freshers and a course on it. You want to go in data science na? Uske liye main aapko YouTube par bahut saare courses hain, aap woh dekh sakte ho. But uske liye main yeh kahunga because aapne bola na aap fresher ho. Pehle aap Python ke upar work karo. Okay? Work on Python, from Python basics to Python advanced. Then try to learn Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib. Yeh jo libraries hain, aap yeh seekho. To yeh sab cheezein jab seekh loge na, to uske baad data science is very easy.

I use AI tools for designing my frontend component. Is it good or should I drop this practice? I mean, see, if you are a fresher, then you should try ki agar tum khud components ko design kar sakte ho. But I...


## This is the example of recorded conversation between Piyush Garg and his audience:- 

- Hey everyone, welcome back welcome back to another exciting video. Aur is video ke andar hum dekhne wale hain kuch very interesting.

- So, yesterday Cursor ne diya hai ki woh ek AI tool hai. Unhone apna ek CLI launch kiya hai. So is video ke andar dekhte hain ki how accurate aur how amazing the Cursor CLI hai. Abhi se pehle maine kabhi bhi Cursor CLI ko try nahi kiya hai. Aur no, this is not a sponsored video. Toh yahan par main ek developer point of view se Cursor CLI ko try karna chahta hoon. How good aur bad it is. Aur maine Cloud CLI ko kaafi zyada use kiya hai. Aur I absolutely loved it. So dekhte hain ki Cursor ka CLI Cloud CLI se comparison mein kaisa hai. Aur also recently because GPT launch hua hai, GPT-5, let's see ki yeh GPT-5 ke saath kaise work karta hai. So with that, let's start with the video.

- Alright, so this is the official page of Cursor CLI. Theek hai? Toh aisa matlab Cloud CLI jaisa hi hai. This is the installation command. So ek kaam karte hain, quickly hum isko install karte hain. So let me just copy this particular command.

- So main open karunga apna terminal. Not integrated, apna default terminal. So you can see ki this is my default terminal. Iske andar hum karenge paste is particular command ko aur hum yahan pe karenge enter. Okay?

- So yahan par hamara jo Cursor CLI hai, downloading Cursor Agent package. Oh done! It was very fast. Theek hai? Toh yahan par mere paas kuch scripts hain jo mujhe run karni hongi. That is echo. Toh isko hum kar lete hain copy-paste. Yeh basically path export kar raha hai aur phir hum karenge source so that mujhe apne terminal ko restart na karna pade. Aur jab bhi isko start karna hai, humein use karna hai cursor agent.

- Toh ek kaam karte hain. Main ek coding folder ke andar ek new directory bana leta hoon. mkdir let's say test-cli. Okay? cd karte hain hamare test-cli ke andar. Aur yahan par main Cursor IDE ko hi open kar leta hoon. I know humein Cursor CLI test karna hai, but theek hai. So you can see ki yeh hai hamara Cursor ka IDE aur GPT-5 ki support hai, that is amazing.

- Toh yahan pe hum apna integrated terminal open kar lete hain. Aur Cursor ke CLI ke saath kaam karne ke liye humein likhna hoga cursor agent. Okay? cursor agent aur enter. So let's see if it's working aur mujhe sign in karna padega. Toh enter karte hain. Aur yahan pe theek hai, hum apna sign in kar lete hain. I'm already logged in to cursor.com. So let's wait for a while. So I'll just say yes, login.

- Toh humne kiya login, toh yahan pe usually "Login successful. Authentication successful." Nice! Alright, so abhi hum aa chuke hain apne IDE ke andar. Let's see yeh kaise kaam karta hai.

- So the command is cursor agent. Toh isko hum kar lete hain copy aur yahan pe hum karenge paste. So you can see my Cursor Agent is up and running. Aur agar hum yahan pe slash (/) pe click karenge, mere paas kuch commands hain. Right? So ek kaam karte hain.

- Hum model select kar sakte hain. So yahan pe model kaun sa? GPT-5 is also available. Toh ek kaam karte hain, GPT-5 ko test karte hain. Main isko bolunga "Hi". Just a single "Hi". I just want to see ki kya yeh work kar raha hai ya nahi. Okay?

- Toh GPT-5 ek "Hi" bolne ke liye... "Hi! What can I help you build and debug today?" Jan greeted and prepared for your task. Okay, nice!

- Toh ek kaam karte hain. Isse hum ek simple application banana start karte hain. "Can you create a simple to-do app for me in HTML and CSS?" Let's see what it does.

- So it is generating. Abhi hum use kar rahe hain GPT-5. Aur pata hai GPT-5 ki ek khaas baat kya hai? It can actually think ki kya mujhe think karna chahiye ki nahi. Jaise for example yahan pe isne think nahi kiya, but yahan pe because maine isko ek task diya, toh yeh think kar raha hai. Toh 60 tokens isne mere use kar diye hain just for thinking.

- Let's see how much it will think. Bhai ek to-do app banane ke liye itna think karne ki zaroorat hai? Nahi, waise. Right? Just go ahead aur banao na. Generating. Okay?

- Toh iska thinking process ho chuka hai complete. Now it is generating. Toh karo bhai, generate karo. To-do app kahan hai mera to-do app? To-do app ban ja bhai! Are itne mein toh main khud bhi bana leta. Oh ban gaya, ban gaya, ban gaya! Nice, nice, ban gaya. Okay, okay.

- So you can see ki isne kuch HTML dala, kuch CSS daal di. Kaafi kaafi CSS daal di. In fact, aur ek kaam karte hain. Isko hum run karke dekhte hain. Toh isko hum karenge open with Live Server. Toh dekhte hain isne kya banaya.

- Oh! Okay, this actually looks good to be honest. Okay. Abhi bhi yeh generate kar raha hai kuch na kuch. Okay, nice.

- Okay, this actually looks good yaar. Pehla matlab okay. I'll just add a follower. "Create a JS file as well to give all kinds of functionalities like create, delete, and update as well." Okay?

- Toh humne isko bola ki yaar ek JS file banao jisse mujhe saari capabilities mil jaye. Right? Create, delete, aur update. Toh abhi yeh think kar raha hai. Because abhi kya hai na, yeh static hai. Main kuch kar nahi sakta kuch khaas. But mujhe design kaafi achha laga. You can see the gradient here. Dekho yahan pe gradient hai, yahan pe vo sab cheezein.

- Okay, so it is again thinking. Toh bhai ko think karne dete hain hum. Hum isko thinking mein disturb nahi karna chahte. Ho gaya, think ho gaya.

Arey arey arey bhai bhai bhai! Kuch toh kiya isne. Theek hai, kuch nahi kiya. 622 tokens in thinking. Ab generating mein jayega. Yeh toh pehle think karta hai, phir yeh generate karta hai. Achha, abhi bhai ki thinking khatam nahi hui.

Main GPT ko bhai kyun bol raha hoon? Kya main isse darta hoon? Maybe.

"Read to files, read index, read style.css." Generating.

Bhai mere ko design kaafi achha laga. Yeh dekho isne checkbox ko bhi override kiya hai. Dekho checkbox dekho kaisa banaya isne. Kaise banaya hai yeh isne? Let me just check. Isne checkbox ke liye kya kiya hai. I don't know. Custom checkbox.

"Check the items to mark complete. To change and add task, edit HTML if you want to add remove your button. I can add tiny HTML." Isne yahan pe tip daal di hai.

"I am going to wire up the JavaScript file to create, add, update, delete, and toggle complete functionality rights. And todo ko local storage mein persist bhi karega. Aur update the HTML CSS to include an input form and script tag."

Oh thoda advanced aa raha hai yeh. Okay, theek hai. Isko karne dete hain. Thoda slow hai. I think that is my initial thing. Mujhe nahi pata ki yeh CLI ka problem hai ya phir GPT-5 ka problem hai. But definitely thoda slow toh hai. Toh thoda wait karna padta hai. It's like you know ki agent hai ki tum isko peeche chhod do. You go, have your coffee. You chill out, aur yeh apna kaam karta rahega. Yeh thoda us tarah ka hai.

See, banana shuru kar diya na isne. Isne HTML mera update kar diya. Aur sabse badi baat hai yaar, yeh mere se pooch bhi nahi raha hai. Yeh kar raha hai. Mere se pooch le bhai ki update karna hai ki nahi? Kar deta hai yeh update bas.

Okay, chalo JavaScript file toh ban gayi. Ab isne JavaScript bhi achhi khaasi likh di hai. Ab mujhe yeh nahi pata ki yeh kaam kar rahi hai ki nahi. Dekhte hain.

Oh okay, kuch toh hua. Delete ka icon. Add a new task. Abhi I think iske upar hi styling karega.

The model provided an ambiguous search to replace. Okay.

Hum... okay. Abhi kaafi simple hai. Isne thoda sa UI bigaad diya. Abhi taarif ki thi UI ki aur isne bigaad diya.

Aur yeh local storage ke andar persisted bhi hai. Pata hai agar main yahan pe inspect karta hoon, aur application > local storage mein jaata hoon, this thing. You can see isne simple todo items yahan pe persist bhi kari hain. See yahan pe meri todo items aa rahi hain.

Abhi bhi yeh kuch na kuch kar toh raha hai. Karne dete hain isko. Okay, let me just create a new task. "That is record video." Add. Theek hai? "Reply to emails." This thing.

"Record video" aaya. Completed hai false. Agar hum isko complete mark kar dete hain, toh yeh true ho jata hai. Nice. Isko hum update kar denge. "Record video update." Enter. Toh yeh yahan pe bhi update hua. Aur isko hum delete kar dete hain. Toh yahan se delete ho gaya. Oh delete nahi hua. Oh nice!

See all this CSS is updated. Kitna pyara lag raha hai yaar yeh. Nice!

Add. Okay, actually cool man. Actually cool.

"Isko draggable bana de. Main chahta hoon ki main isko drag kar paun. Theek hai? Make the items of todo draggable in animated manner." Enter.

Let's see. "Make the items of todo draggable in animated manner."

GPT-5 slow hai, but it is actually very good to be honest.

Aur mujhe cursor pata nahi kyun mujhe checkbox thoda achha laga. Thoda unique hai. Aur color scheme isne kaafi achhi choose kiya hai. Matlab you know thoda glow hai har jagah. You can see. Aur you know jab hum iske upar hover kar rahe hain, there is a little bit shift. Toh mujhe yeh cheez thodi achhi lagi. Micro interactions are really nice.

Hum so abhi yeh draggable ka kuch toh code likh raha hai. Toh abhi yeh saare jo hain na...

Arey, this is actually pretty cool man. Matlab can you see this?

Abhi isne poora karna shuru nahi kiya hai. But wow, see how smooth animation hai. Aur koi library use nahi kar raha hai yeh. See haan, yahan pe thoda sa bug toh hai, but pretty cool man.

Okay, frontend ki job toh hai khatre mein. To be honest. Dekho yaar, agar aise frontends ban rahe hain, toh thoda khatre mein toh hai.

Kya yeh poori website clone kar sakta hai? Nice! Yeh dekho. Yeh dekho. Yeh aa gaya yahan pe. Isko main upar le jata hoon. Yeh hum isko yahan pe kahin na kahin place kar sakte hain. Hai na?

Yeh dekho niche wala dragging is very nice. Upar wala dragging thoda difficult hai. But jo hum niche drag kar rahe hain, bahut achha hai. Aur agar main isko refresh karta hoon na, screen ko you can see it persist. Yeh dekho refresh kar rahe hain. Hum isko... yeh persist kar raha hai. Theek hai?

Aur ek kaam karte hain. Kya hum isko Kanban mein convert kar sakte hain? Abhi bhi yeh kuch think kar raha hai. You know still it is doing something. But yaar yeh bahut bahut sundar banaya isne. I am really impressed.

Okay. "Can you convert this whole application to Kanban-style board?" Enter. Let's see. Yeh thoda bada task hai. Because isme kaafi zyada refactoring ayega. So let's see how well it can actually refactor the code.

Yahan pe I think mere tokens bhi zyada use honge. Theek hai?

Kitna use kiya isne? By the way, agar hum yahan pe you know meri profile mein jaate hain, account settings mein. I am abhi toh isne kuch use kiya nahi hai. Theek hai? Abhi maybe thodi der mein active ho jayega. That how much the usage is going on. Cloud 5 input-output cache and output. Theek hai? Abhi update nahi hua. I think yeh thodi der mein update hoga. But that's okay. Okay?

So wapas chalte hain hamare to-do application ke upar. So "Can you convert this?" Abhi yeh think kar raha hai. I think iske andar jo thinking process hai, vo thoda sa zyada jayega. But let it think. Let it think.

Alright. So thinking process toh hamara hua khatam, which used around 1100 tokens. Ab yeh kar raha hai generate. So isko generate karne dete hain. Let's see how well it generates.

Nice! Okay. Toh cheezein change hona shuru ho gayi hain. Visually dekhte hain kaise-kaise update aata hai.

Oh isne yahan pe aise bana diya. Okay dekhte hain kya karta hai. Matlab to-do ka ek board hai, in-progress ka ek board hai, done ka ek board hai. Ideally main chahta hoon ki agar yeh horizontally stacked ho.

Okay. Okay. I am very impressed. Yahan pe hi main kaafi zyada impressed hoon. To-do ka board, in-progress aur done ka board. Tum ek cheez notice kar rahe ho, like how well actually it is doing things. Matlab jaise ek human karta hai na ki let's do one step at a time, aur phir think, aur phir do the second step at a time. Toh yeh actually mein it is doing one step at a time.

See, and yeh UX ka kaafi achhe se khayal rakh raha hai. Toh bhai frontend walon, thoda bahut backend seekh lo. Warna toh mushkil hai is AI world mein rehna.

Dekho yaar, agar aap sirf aur sirf frontend pe bet kar rahe ho, toh thoda difficult toh hai. Because you can see, maine kisi bhi code ko touch tak nahi kiya hai. Aapke saamne hai. Maine kisi bhi code ko touch nahi kiya hai. Aur you know, these things, these animations, aur these small things, sab kitna bhiya se yeh generate kar raha hai.

460 tokens. 578 tokens. Theek hai. Three files. Editor slash for commands.

Kya think karta hai yeh? Itna think toh main nahi karta coding karte samay. Thinking... yeh na ek agent as a background agent kaafi achha hai. Matlab bana ke chhod do, aur let it do this tough.

Oh nice! Thoda UI toh kharaab hua. Thoda sa toh UI kharaab hua. See yahan pe itna gap kyun hai?

Hum kuch zyada hi smooth animations hain. Yeh wali animation itni achhi nahi hai. Abhi hum... but theek hai. It was able to do a good job to be honest.

So yaar, what is my thinking on it? Ki abhi yeh beta mein hai, to be honest. Aur agar yeh beta mein itna achha perform kar raha hai, down the line in six months, this is going to be really amazing.

Dekho, I will tell you my clicks. Maine na Cloud CLI jo hai, vo kaafi use kar raha hoon. Aur it is actually amazing. Jis tarah se vo code karta hai, it is on point. Vo bina kisi bug ke single prompt ke andar poora-poora feature develop kar deta hai.

Cursor CLI basically kya kar raha hai? Yeh multi-modal mein aa jata hai. Because iske paas GPT ka access bhi hai, Cloud ka access bhi hai. So I think abhi yeh beta mein hai, but down the line agar iske andar ek automatic ho gaya na ki kaun sa model mujhe choose karna chahiye, kaise kaam karna chahiye, this is going to be a really game-changer.

So yaar dekho, agar aap sirf aur sirf frontend development pe bet kar rahe ho, toh thoda sa danger toh hai. Because you know frontend ke andar bahut saare tools aa chuke hain. Like V0 aa chuka hai, jo ki pretty amazing hai. Aur upar se ab yeh CLI jaise cheez bhi frontend ko bana pa rahi hai.

Toh you should definitely look out to upskill yourself into the backend aur you know core jo low-level cheez hoti hai na uske andar.

Toh ya, that was my crux on this particular video. Aapko yeh CLI kaisa laga, mujhe comments mein zaroor batana. Aur you can also give me some prompts jisko main try out kar sakta hoon in the next video. So aap is video ke comments mein kuch prompts dena. Okay? Full-fledged application ke main aapke saamne un prompts ko try karunga, that how well it can perform.

So that was all about this particular video. Video achha laga toh like aur subscribe zaroor karna. Milte hain aapko next video ke andar. Until then, bye-bye aur take care.
